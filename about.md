Hello, World! My name is Sidhant Bhavnani, I'm a 15 year old Highschooler and OSSU student and I like making stuff. Most of my projects are with computers but I'm open to working on anything intresting.
I enjoy experimenting due to which I wear lots of hats, This comic by Natalya in her article on name calling discribes me best.
