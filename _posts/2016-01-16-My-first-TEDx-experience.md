On the 16th I attended my first conference, TEDxHansraj. Wait let me start from the beginning. I stumbled upon the event on the last day of registration, I didn't think twice about it and I just registered. A day later I got a mail saying that I got selected and that I needed to pay to attend(Nothing too big, it was just 1000â‚¹). I don't have a card or PayPal yet, so I chose to pay at their dropoff location.

I gave the guy who's contact details were on the email a call and he told me to meet him at the drop off location(the Green Park metro station)  . It was a pretty shady exchange of cash, he got off the metro wearing a hoodie and he asked if I was the guy, I gave him my name and the cash and both of us parted our ways. On my ride back a lot of things flew through my head because I didn't get any bill stating that I've paid and the only exchange of words that I had with him were:

>him: You the guy?

>me: yes.

Later in the night, around 1AM I got a mail saying that my invite has been conform, it was a bit of a relief.

16th morning I Ubered till Hansraj, they had a very simple setup, tiny X's along the path way to the registration. I got my self registered and went for some tea.

The talks were interesting, well most of them, Gaurav Gupta, he spoke about how he is a soft man and how he loves playing with soft toys...The other talks were interesting and thought provoking. Speakers like Deepa Rajpal, Richard Rakhy and Poonam Begai were truly inspirational.
