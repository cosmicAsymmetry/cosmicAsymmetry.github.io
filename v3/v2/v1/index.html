		<h2>Hello, World!</h2>
		<p> My name is <a>Sidhant Bhavnani</a>. My life is governed by simplicity, I believe that the simple things in life are the most beautiful, let it be a photon being captured by the camera or a simple div tag in HTML or printing "Hello, World!" for the first time. My life goal is to push the boundaries of what we know and make lives of people simpler.</p>
		<h2>My Education</h2>
		<p>Over the past few months i have lost hope in the Indian education system. i feel it not only stops the personal growth of the child but also puts a end to creativity.<br> Hence, over the past few months i have found a <b>new way of learning, Edx</b> ! i not only get to learn what i like to learn but also from the best from around the world.<br> i have taken <a href="https://verify.edx.org/cert/4be679d0497b464085fd1975c36b1b0f">6.00.1x from MITx</a>,<a href="https://verify.edx.org/cert/53b58eaa15e44236b37cf0e2070a8429"> 6.00.2x from MITx</a>,<a href="https://verify.edx.org/cert/816925a4b55c416cb6ac50a504ab5d26"> COMP102x from HKUSTx</a>,<a href="https://verify.edx.org/cert/7e20b21860b24aefa3a0ca80e3a945fc">ASTRO3x from ANUx</a> and<a href="https://verify.edx.org/cert/8b5b00e3a73343ddae19c7d1a70bd8f7"> 11.132x from MITx</a></p>
