Hello, World! My name is Sidhant Bhavnani, I'm a 15 year old Highschooler and Open Source Society University student and I like making stuff. Most of my projects are with computers but I'm open to working on anything interesting.
I enjoy experimenting due to which I wear lots of hats, This comic by Natalya in her article on name calling describes me best.

I almost work with everything from data science to web development. My favourite language to work with is Python.
